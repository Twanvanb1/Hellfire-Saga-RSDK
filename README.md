# FAQ
### Q: I found a bug!
A: Submit them under the `issues` tab and I will try to fix it.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> make sure you have the latest build of [RSDKv4](https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation) and the [Sonic 1 & 2 Scripts](https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Script-Decompilation).

### Q: I have a feature request. Will you add it? 
A: Most likely not, this will be a straight port of the Mega Drive/Genisis

### Q: When will this be finished?
A: It's done whenever it is done. Nobody runs on a deadline, it's all done based on motivation & time.

### Q: Will there be an Android, iOS, Steam Deck, etc port?
A: Everything in this project comes as-is. If it doesn't run on a specific platform, don't get your hopes up on it being fixed.
